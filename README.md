### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm building [LBRY](https://github.com/lbryio), a decentralized media protocol for the modern era. It underlies [Odysee](https://odysee.com), the community-first video site that Youtube could have been if it hadn't sold out to ad companies.

If this kind of project speaks to you, reach out! I'd love to chat.

Find me at [grin.io](https://grin.io) or on Twitter at [@lyoshenka](https://twitter.com/lyoshenka).
