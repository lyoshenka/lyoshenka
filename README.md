### Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on [Cabin](https://cabin.city), a network city of modern villages. We help you upgrade your local neighborhood to be the kind of place you'd want to grow up in: more social, more communal, more intergenerational, more values-aligned. Then we connect you to similar neighborhoods around the world to form the Cabin network city.

Before Cabin, I founded [LBRY](https://github.com/lbryio) -- a decentralized media protocol for the modern era. LBRY powers [Odysee](https://odysee.com), the community-first video site that Youtube could have been if it hadn't sold out to ad companies.

On the side, I've launched several URL-to-IRL events and conferences for online communities, including [VibeCamp](https://vibe.camp), [FarCon](https://farcon.xyz), and [TNS Camp](https://tns.camp).
